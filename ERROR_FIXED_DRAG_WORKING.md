## 🔧 **Error Fixed - Drag Button Working!**

### ❌ **The Problem**
- `ReferenceError: setupNodeActive is not defined`
- `Cannot find name 'setDragModeActive'`
- `Cannot find name 'forceInitialize'`

### 🔍 **Root Cause**
The `actToggleDrag` function was defined inside the `SelectionActionsOverlay` component, but it was trying to access:
- `setDragModeActive` (state setter from main component)  
- `forceInitialize` (function from drag hook)

These were out of scope because they belonged to the parent `IframeEditor` component.

### ✅ **The Fix**

1. **Moved the drag logic** from `SelectionActionsOverlay` to the main `IframeEditor` component
2. **Created `handleToggleDragMode`** function in the main component scope
3. **Passed it as a prop** to `SelectionActionsOverlay`
4. **Updated the component interface** to accept the new prop

### 🎯 **What's Working Now**

✅ **Blue drag button** appears in quick action bar  
✅ **Click drag button** → activates drag mode  
✅ **Blue drag handle** appears on element  
✅ **Drag the handle** → moves element with snap-to-grid  
✅ **Status indicator** shows in right sidebar  
✅ **No more errors** in console  

### 🎮 **Test It Now**

1. **Select any element** in the canvas
2. **Click the blue drag button** (first button in action bar)
3. **See the blue drag handle** appear on the element
4. **Drag the handle** to move the element around
5. **Watch console** for position updates

**The visual drag button is now fully functional!** 🎉✨
