# Vercel Build Error Fixes

This document outlines the fixes implemented to resolve Vercel build errors related to environment variables and Supabase configuration.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Environment Variable Non-null Assertions

**Problem**: The codebase was using non-null assertions (`!`) when accessing environment variables, which can cause build failures if the variables are undefined.

**Files affected**:
- `src/lib/supabase/client.ts`
- `src/lib/supabase/server.ts`
- `src/middleware.ts`

**Solution**: Replaced non-null assertions with proper validation and error handling.

### 2. Missing Environment Variable Validation

**Problem**: No centralized validation for environment variables, making it difficult to debug missing configurations.

**Solution**: Created a comprehensive environment validation system:

#### New Files Created:

1. **`src/lib/env.ts`** - Environment validation utility
   - Validates required environment variables
   - Provides helpful error messages
   - Centralizes environment configuration
   - Includes development-time warnings

2. **`.env.example`** - Environment variable template
   - Documents all required and optional variables
   - Provides examples for each configuration
   - Serves as reference for deployment

3. **`scripts/validate-env.js`** - Build-time validation script
   - Runs during build process
   - Catches missing variables early
   - Provides clear error messages and solutions

4. **`docs/vercel-build-fixes.md`** - This documentation file

## Required Environment Variables

The following environment variables are **required** for the application to build and run:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

## Optional Environment Variables

These variables are optional but may be needed for full functionality:

```bash
# Supabase Service Role (for admin operations)
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key

# Database
DATABASE_URL=your_database_url
DIRECT_URL=your_direct_database_url

# Authentication
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your_nextauth_secret

# Application
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000

# Stripe (for payments)
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your_stripe_secret_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_stripe_publishable_key
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_stripe_webhook_secret

# Google Cloud (for AI features)
GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
GOOGLE_CLOUD_PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key
GOOGLE_CLOUD_CLIENT_EMAIL=your_client_email

# Storage
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_storage_bucket

# Email (optional)
EMAIL_SERVER_HOST=your_email_host
EMAIL_SERVER_PORT=587
EMAIL_SERVER_USER=your_email_user
EMAIL_SERVER_PASSWORD=your_email_password
EMAIL_FROM=noreply@yourapp.com

# Analytics (optional)
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_ID=your_ga_id
```

## How to Fix Vercel Build Errors

### Step 1: Set Environment Variables in Vercel

1. Go to your Vercel project dashboard
2. Navigate to **Settings** â†’ **Environment Variables**
3. Add the required environment variables:
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
4. Add any optional variables your application needs
5. Make sure to set them for the correct environments (Production, Preview, Development)

### Step 2: Validate Environment Variables Locally

Run the validation script to check your local environment:

```bash
npm run validate-env
```

This will show you which variables are missing and provide guidance on how to fix them.

### Step 3: Test the Build Process

Test the build locally to ensure it works:

```bash
npm run build
```

The build process now includes automatic environment validation and will fail early with helpful error messages if variables are missing.

### Step 4: Deploy to Vercel

Once environment variables are set and the build works locally, deploy to Vercel:

```bash
vercel --prod
```

Or push to your connected Git repository to trigger automatic deployment.

## Code Changes Summary

### Updated Files:

1. **`src/lib/supabase/client.ts`**
   - Added environment validation using `getSupabaseConfig()`
   - Removed non-null assertions
   - Improved error handling

2. **`src/lib/supabase/server.ts`**
   - Added environment validation for both client and service role functions
   - Removed non-null assertions
   - Centralized configuration through `getSupabaseConfig()`

3. **`src/middleware.ts`**
   - Added proper error handling for missing environment variables
   - Improved type safety
   - Added try-catch block for graceful error handling

4. **`package.json`**
   - Added `validate-env` script
   - Integrated environment validation into build process

## Benefits of These Changes

1. **Early Error Detection**: Environment issues are caught during build time, not runtime
2. **Better Error Messages**: Clear, actionable error messages help developers fix issues quickly
3. **Type Safety**: Proper TypeScript types and validation prevent runtime errors
4. **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation and examples for all environment variables
5. **Development Experience**: Automatic validation during development with helpful warnings
6. **Production Reliability**: Graceful error handling prevents application crashes

## Troubleshooting

### Build Still Failing?

1. **Check Vercel Logs**: Look at the build logs in Vercel dashboard for specific error messages
2. **Verify Environment Variables**: Ensure all required variables are set in Vercel settings
3. **Test Locally**: Run `npm run build` locally to reproduce the issue
4. **Check Variable Names**: Ensure environment variable names match exactly (case-sensitive)
5. **Clear Build Cache**: Try clearing Vercel's build cache and redeploying

### Common Issues:

- **Typos in variable names**: Double-check spelling and case
- **Missing variables in specific environments**: Ensure variables are set for Production, Preview, and Development
- **Incorrect Supabase URLs**: Verify your Supabase project URL and keys are correct
- **Quotes in environment values**: Remove quotes around environment variable values in Vercel settings

## Next Steps

After implementing these fixes:

1. Monitor your Vercel deployments to ensure they're successful
2. Test all application features to ensure they work with the new environment setup
3. Update your team documentation with the new environment variable requirements
4. Consider setting up automated tests that validate environment configuration
